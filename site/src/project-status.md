## Project Status

### HEADLINE: USABLE, PRE-ALPHA


### DEV STATE: Updating

This project has been used "as-is" succesfully in the past. It should be
actually useful as is right now too :-)

I thought it could do with packaging and some updating.  That's why this
project page got created.

Short roadmap would be:

* Look to see if we can go python3
* Support for Rasp Pi camera (if I buy one or am donated one)
* Integration between the three modes of operation:
    * Stop Motion
    * Time based time lapse
    * Video change based time lapse

(More detail and roadmap coming later)
